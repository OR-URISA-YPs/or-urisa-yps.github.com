If you'd like to help jekyll-bootstrap get better here's how you can do it!

## Why Help?

Jekyll Bootstrap's _technical_ (in terms of software &amp; programming) objective
is to create a standardized, well-tuned API for creating and maintaining Jekyll-powered blogs.
Why? Well after deciding to finally setup my programming blog with Jekyll, I found out first-hand how much of a pain in the ass it is.
After hacking it up, I realized there was no way to contribute what I learned because the Jekyll community is fragmented.
So I thought it would be helpful to bring it together.

"Bringing it together" makes no sense if there is no one to bring together.
That's where you come in. We all get together and help the technical blogging community evolve. Glad to have you!



## How to Contribute 

All collaboration and correspondence should take place on GitHub. Please make 
extensive use of the issue tracking system, code commenting, and pull requests.

Please make sure to read the README.md file in the repo as it contains more detailed contribution workflows.


## Core Areas

### Community

Above all, if nobody knows about Jekyll-bootstrap, nobody is going to benefit from Jekyll-bootstrap,
so please help spread the word.

### Theme API

Simple blog themes are needed for Jekyll so people can choose a theme and "drop it in" to their Jekyll site.
Consider hacking on the THEME API to improve the ease of which themes can be created.
Themes, themselves, are always welcomed and needed!
  
### Javascript API

If you are good at javascript we can work together to figure out a definitive client-side plugin strategy for Jekyll.
This is really important because since GitHub pages can't support liquid/jekyll plugins, we can still code robust 
functionality via javascript.
  
### Core Jekyll/Liquid API

This is the core JB framework which interacts with Liquid and Jekyll.
If you are good at ruby and/or Liquid, consider improving the rake tasks or JB helpers.

### Documentation

More content, tutorials information is welcome. You can also proofread existing materials.
