GIS Day Social!


What: Portland’s 6th Annual GIS Day Social

When: Wednesday November 15th, 6:00pm - 9:00pm

Where: Ecotrust, 721 NW 9th Ave #200, Portland, OR


Please join us for Portland’s 6th Annual GIS Day Social! This year, we’ll gather in Ecotrust’s beautiful meeting space from 6pm - 9pm. The evening will feature:

- A keynote from Emily Eros of the Red Cross on the Missing Maps program, which aims to put 200 million people "on the map" by 2021
- Free pizza*, salad and beverages, courtesy of our generous sponsors
- Speed networking to break the ice
- A raffle for some fun geo-prizes!

Students, professionals, and anyone interested in GIS and geospatial technologies are all welcome. This is a great opportunity to make some new professional connections and strengthen old ones, and we hope to see you there!

This event is volunteer run, and would be impossible without the generous support of our sponsors:

Gold level: Quantum Spatial

Silver level: ASPRS CRR, PCC, Ecotrust, Red Cross

Bronze level: OR-URISA, PDX OSGeo, Esri

*Includes some gluten free, veggie, and vegan pizzas
