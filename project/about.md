## Motivation

Jekyll-bootstrap is meant to make it easier for technically-minded people to share their knowledge.

As a self-taught web-developer I am continually indebted to all the diligent people who share their knowledge, bug fixes, and lessons through blogging.

I always thought "I should really share my experiences too", but I never manage to get past the mental obstacle of having to setup a wordpress install
and use some UI to write words. Then do I have to figure out how to highlight code or what?

The point is I'm lazy _in that way_. I have 3 wordpress accounts, a posterous, a sinatra site, and a twitter,
all of which get updated once a year if I'm feeling generous.

### Jekyll is Different.

Actually Jekyll was pretty damned frustrating when I started out - which is why I created Jekyll-bootstrap.
But aside from that, jekyll just feels right to me.

### I want to write articles like I write code.

So this time I feel like I've got something here. This time I feel like Jekyll can finally be the motivation
I need - the convenience I crave - that gets me posting and sharing on a regular basis.

As for my first flurry of content, I would like to share everything I learned about using Jekyll  
**- and that's Jekyll-bootstrap**.


## People

Jekyll-bootstrap is maintained by me, [Jade Dominguez](http://plusjade.com).
I encourage everyone to check out the [contribute](contributing.html) page if you are interested in helping. =)

Mostly I try to contribute to GitHub-backed projects because I have a not-so-secret
mission to somehow work for GitHub in the near future. I still need to plan my attack though.
But if anyone can help, please [contact me](http://plusjade.com)!
